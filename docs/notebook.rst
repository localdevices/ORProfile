Notebook demonstration
======================

For alluvial river profiles, we have implemented methods to fit your bathymetry data to a geomorphological theoretical
profile, providing insights in meandering, sedimentation, and conveyance. The theory behind this is noted in a notebook
that demonstrates the theoretical background and implemented equations. In these docs, this notebook will only show
static results. If you would like to have interactive dynamic results, please run the notebook yourself using the code
base. The notebook is located under the folder ``notebooks``.

`2-dimensional Lacey implementation based on Savenije et al. 2003 <_notebooks/Lacey_implementation.ipynb>`_

We here provide a full demonstration notebook. Please use this as a recipe to get your data organized.
