    "### Theory of bed profile forms implemented in some numpy functions\n",
    "A bed profile model is required to estimate the bathymetry of a channel in 2D. Here we identify a set of functions to estimate the depth profile from a set of parameters that can be measured iun-situ or (ideally!) only at the side of the channel from drone footage. The angles at the sides of the channel are, according to Savenije 2003 and referenced authors, a good representation of bed form similarities. We therefore take these assumed relationships as starting point for our assessment.\n"

It should be noted that the width of the grid does not necessarily follow the actual natural-levee-to-natural-levee width (it can but it does not have to). Instead it follows the trajectory of an equal-in-elevation channel form that can reasonably be surveyed.
