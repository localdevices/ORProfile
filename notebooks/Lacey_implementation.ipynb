    "### Theory of bed profile forms implemented in some numpy functions\n",
    "A bed profile model is required to estimate the bathymetry of a channel in 2D. Here we identify a set of functions to estimate the depth profile from a set of parameters that can be measured iun-situ or (ideally!) only at the side of the channel from drone footage. The angles at the sides of the channel are, according to Savenije 2003 and referenced authors, a good representation of bed form similarities. We therefore take these assumed relationships as starting point for our assessment.\n"
