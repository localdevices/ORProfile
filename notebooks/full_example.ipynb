    "- [x] prepare a \"mesh\" object from a set of splines of the dry-wet interface and up and downstream boundaries\n",

    "Let's explain this further. ORPRofile has a so-called `Mesh` class, which generates a mesh (or grid) with some intelligence. A mesh is essentially a grid, in our case a so-called curvilinear grid. It looks almost like a regular grid but can be shaped in certain directions. A `Mesh` object can consequently read in your data, analyze the likely geomorphological regime belonging to it by fitting a model based on Lacey's equation, and then estimate depths using the fit within the mesh grid cells. This can then provide insights on the bathymetry, and also where the Lacey assumptions do not seem to apply very well. This is where residuals between observations and fitted depths are poor. These are likely locations where there is some non-natural influence on the sedimentation process. Naturally this only applies in alluvial depositing stream sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, in the code we simply say that we want a mesh initiated within the area defined by the 4 splines, and that this mesh should contain 20 rows and 10 columns. The mesh will then be made in between the 4 splines. The plot also shows a nice satellite view. There are some further options for the plot, which are documented in our API documentation. Please have a look at that for further options."
